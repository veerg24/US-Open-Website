            <p align="center">I have been to four consecutive US Opens (2014-2017) and I have to say that they are always the greatest highlight of my year. 
            <br>Whether you know tennis or no, you are bound to have a great time at the tournament. But there are some tips and tricks in order
            to<br>have more fun and watch some great high quality tennis.</p>

            <h3 align="center" id="Tip 1"><strong>Tip #1: The Best Quality Matches Are Not Always On Ashe</strong></h3> 
            <p align="center">I am a huge die-hard tennis player and fan myself and watching quality tennis is the most important thing for me when I visit 
            the open every year.<br>You should do whatever you can to watch great players and matches up close. While Arthur Ashe might seem like the ideal place to watch a tennis match, <br>it actually doesn't 
            always have the highest quality tennis (unless you are willing to spend a lot of money to buy tickets for the later stages
            in the tournament). In 2016, <br>I was presented with a ticket (About $300)into Ashe stadium so I would be guaranteed 
            to watch a top 10 player. The seat was located on the second level (little bit below half way). <br>While it was a spectacular 
            to experience the atmosphere and the stadium, I was still somewhat far away from the court and the players. <br>Even
            the players look tiny, especially the further up you sit. Now, you might still be thinking how does the view from
            the seat affect the <br>fact that the best quality matches are not on Ashe. The tournament committee will always put first big
            stars (Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer etc.) on Ashe <br>rather than what would be a better match. This usually results in big stars
            defeating their opponents with ease without many magnificent points<br> (only exception is if you aren't on a budget and are willing to spend a lot 
            of money to purchase good seats close to the court for rounds such as the 3rd round or above). <br>As the 2016 tournament ended, I came to the conclusion
            that the <strong>smaller courts are fantastic for watching great players and excellent quality matches up close. </strong><p>

            <br>Based on this observation, <strong>I got to see top 30 players playing some 
            extremely good tennis in epic matches on small courts<br>(Louis Armstrong, Courts #4-#16, and Court #17, the coolest court that is below ground level) 
            from just a<br>couple of feet away in 2017.</strong> (That is a picture of Lucas Pouille after winning his match taken by me from my seat)

            <h3 align="center" id="Tip 2"><strong>Tip #2: Autographs and Photographs</strong></h3> 
            <p align="center">If you are interested in getting players autographs and taking photos with them, the <strong>smaller courts are your best friends.</strong> 
            Although it might seem<br>difficult to get autographs, it can be <strong>quite simple if you make the right decisions.</strong> Towards the end of the match,
            make sure to be sitting either <br><strong>behind their chair</strong> (although it gets extremely crowded because everybody gathers there) or <strong>near
            the place where the players exit</strong><br>(recommend sitting near the exit for courts except for Ashe, Louis Armstong, New Grandstand).<br>

            <h3 align="center" id="Tip 3"><strong>Tip #3: Do Not Drive Unless it's really Necessary</strong></h3>
            <center>Driving and parking can be a real pain when there are hundreds of thousands of other people with the same idea. It would be quite a challenge<br>to find
            parking and with the insane amount of people present, the rates would most certainly increase. I would <strong>strongly recommend taking a 
            <br>train to the Park.</strong> The station is located very conveniently near the east gate. Another <strong>excellent option is taking a hotel shuttle<br></strong>(if your hotel provides
            it) to the open. Shuttles are <strong>convenient since they usually run every 30 mins and drop you off at a<br>specific area near the south gate.</strong>
            <br><br><img src="http://reliableshuttle.com/graphics/busoutside.jpg" width="500"height="350" 
            <br><br>Hotel Shuttle
            <br><br>Now that you have reached the open, you still need a way to get back to your hotel or house. <strong>Do not try to call an Uber.</strong> 
            With thousands of other people<br>trying to call an Uber, it can get crazy to call an Uber. Also the cost of the Uber will jump up due to the 
            rush. <strong>I would suggest returning in either the train<br>or the shuttle again. The shuttle continues to run until very late at night, but 
            keep in my mind the time of the last stop the shuttle makes to the open<br>or else you will have no other option than to either take the train, call an Uber,
            or try to catch a taxi which is hectic.</center>
